I"Œ<p>CBC test is part of a routine medical exam. If there is an abnormal result on your CBC, what other tests might the doctor suggest?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abnormal results for WBCs</strong> may be followed by a culture of the affected area.
 If inflammation is suspected, then aÂ CRPÂ orÂ ESR testÂ may be done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abnormal RBCs</strong> may request aÂ reticulocyte count,Â iron studies,Â tests for vitamin B12 and folic acid,Â G6PD, orÂ hemoglobinopathy evaluationÂ to help make a diagnosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abnormal platelet count</strong> may be followed by tests that further evaluate platelets, such asÂ platelet function testsÂ orÂ HIT antibody. Additional tests may also be done to check forÂ bleeding disordersÂ orÂ excessive clotting disordersÂ such asÂ PT,Â PTT,Â von Willebrand factorÂ orÂ coagulation factors. In some serious conditions such asÂ leukemia, myelodysplasia or anotherÂ bone marrow disorderÂ is suspected, then aÂ bone marrow biopsy and examinationÂ may be necessary. Numerous other tests specific for certain conditions may be needed to establish a diagnosis.</p>
