I"Ž<p>We usually prepare N.S in the laboratory for several uses. And, we should make sure that our preparation is accurate by:</p>

<p>1.Put 1 mL of N.S that we had prepared into test tube</p>

<p>2.Add two drop of the blood in the same test tube</p>

<p>3.Centerfuge for 1 mines</p>

<p>If the N.S suspension is clear: accurate preparation 
If the N.S suspension is hemolysis: defect preparation</p>
