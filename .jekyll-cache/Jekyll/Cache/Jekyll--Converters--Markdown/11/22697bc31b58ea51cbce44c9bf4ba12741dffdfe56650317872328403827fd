I"<p>I will try to write some tips to make a good report for bacteria culture of microbiology. The final report differ based on the type of sample.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>No bacterial growth: in blood culture because the blood sample in stiral, it doesnâ€™t contain any bacteria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No pathogenic bacterial growth: in sputum or vaginal sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No significant  bacterial  growth: in urine sample because it could contain the same bacteria pathogen and normal flora. 
we differentiate by the number of colonies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No salmonella and shigela isolated: in stool sample for adult</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Salmonella and Shigela and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli  isolated: in stool sample for children</p>
  </li>
</ol>
