I"	<p>Here are the things you should know when conducting coagulation tests</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulty in obtaining a venous sample, resulting in hemolysis or small dots in sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sample should be centrifugated for 15 mins at 3000 RPM to get poor plasma of platelets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t delay  in testing the plasma and leaving the sample at room temperature more 4 hours</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should use glass test tube in clotting time test, because if you do the test in plastic tube the blood will not clot until five to ten minutes have passed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drug ingestion affecting platelets function such as Aspirin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In bleeding time test the blood pressure cuff maintained too high “ &gt;40mm Hg producing false positive result</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should prewarmed the sample and reagent in water bath prior to use (the sample 3-5 mins and the reagent 5-10 mins)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partial clotting of specimen in platelets count producing Falsely low count</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small RBCs or fragments of RBCs can be counted as platelets as in sever microcytosis or fragmentation of erythrocytes in platelets count producing Falsely high count</p>
  </li>
</ul>
