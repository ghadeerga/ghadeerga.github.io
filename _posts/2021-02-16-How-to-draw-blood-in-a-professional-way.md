---

At the beginning, I will introduce you to the basic things that you will use during your blood draw.

Needle: it has types and sizes, including the butterfly, which is usually used for children or the elderly or for withdrawing from the back of the palm of the hand and it is considered the least pain because it has the smallest opening or Needle tip.

The adapter is connected to the Butterfly, especially if the patients have to do many tests.

Some patients have a lot of analyzes and require many tubes for analysis. Could range from 1-6 tubes, and since the Butterfly has a small opening, the blood flow will be slow and it may stop the blood because the vein has become collapsed. We have to draw blood again from a different place;So choosing the needle size is very important

**The problems that we can face when drawing blood (the blood does not flow into the tube), it may be because of**:

1. Intravenous. Collapse
2. The needle came out of the vein
3. The angle of the needle is wrong, it only needs to be inclined by a few millimeters
4. The tube is not inserted into a cup in the adapter, make sure that it is inserted


**There is a certain order that we need to follow when drawing blood into tubes As following:**

1. Blood culture

2. Citrate

3. Serum

4. Heparin

5. EDTA

6. Cross atch

7. Fluoride Oxalate


**Here are some tips to follow that may help you in blood draw:**

1. Dealing with patients will help to select the appropriate needle size to draw blood, it may be useful to ask them what hand they usually draws blood from
2. Using the Tourniquet helps to clear the vein and reduce pain for the patient
