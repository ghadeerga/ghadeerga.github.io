adapter is connected to the Butterfly, especially if the patients have many tests 

Some patients have a lot of analyzes and require many tubes for analysis. Possible ranges from 1-6 tubes, and since the Butterfly has a small opening, the blood flow will be slow and it may stop the blood because the vein has become collapsed. We have to draw blood again from a different place;So choosing the needle size is very important

1- Intravenous. Collapse
2- The needle came out of the vein

3- The angle of the needle is wrong, it only needs to be inclined by a few millimeters
