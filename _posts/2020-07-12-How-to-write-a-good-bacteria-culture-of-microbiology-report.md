title: How to write a good bacteria culture of microbiology report 
---

I will try to write some tips to make a good report for bacteria culture of microbiology. The final report differ based on the type of sample. 

1. No bacterial growth: in blood culture because the blood sample in stiral, it doesn't contain any bacteria

2. No pathogenic bacterial growth: in sputum or vaginal sample 

3. No significant  bacterial  growth: in urine sample because it could contain the same bacteria pathogen and normal flora. 
we differentiate by the number of colonies

4. No salmonella and shigela isolated: in stool sample for adult

5. No Salmonella and Shigela and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli  isolated: in stool sample for children
