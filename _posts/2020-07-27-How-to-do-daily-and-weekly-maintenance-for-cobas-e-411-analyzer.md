The cobas e 411 analyzer is designed for both quantitative and qualitative in vitro determination of a wide range of test by the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology. Maintenance procedures are crucial for the device and make sure you performe them while the operating system is off. These maintenance recommendations are based on using the system eight hours per day, five days per week. You may adjust your maintenance frequency based on your laboratory's actual usage.


## Daily maintenance: 

### A ) Cleaning the sample/reagent probe

Dirt on the sample/reagent probe may cause contamination, and affect results. Make sure to clean this part daily to prevent contamination.

1. Switch off the analyzer

2. Move the sample/reagent probe to somewhere where you can readily access it

3. Wipe the outer surfaces of the sample/reagent probe with a gauze soaked in distilled or deionized water

4. If any dirt is visible, wipe the outer surfaces with a gauze soaked in 70% alcohol and a second wipe with a gauze soaked in distilled or deionized water

### B ) Clean the inner compartments

Check the inner compartment or system reagent compartments and wipe off any compartment with dry gauze:

1- Regularly empty the liquid waste container, because a full liquid waste container will interept the the analysis, alos use a 70% isopropyl alcohol to rinse the inner part of the container. Follow with a thorough water rinse.

2. Regularly empty the solid waste form the disposed tips and cups.

## Weekly maintenance

### A) Clean sipper probe


Dirt on the sipper probe may cause contamination and, affecting results, do the following:

1. Open the sipper shield

2. Move the sipper probe to an area where you can readily access it

3. Wipe the outer surfaces of the sipper probe with a gauze soaked in 70% alcohol, followed by a wipe with a gauze soaked in distilled or deionized water, Close the sipper shield

### B) Clean the incubator and aspiration station

Spills on the incubator may cause gripper movement alarm. The incubator and aspiration station should be cleaned regularly as following:

1. Move the sample/reagent probe arm to the far left

2. Move the gripper towards the front of the analyzer

3. Open the sipper shield then move the sipper arm to the far right
 
4. Clean the top of the incubator and aspiration station with gauze  dampened with distilled or deionized water

5. Remove any residual dirt by using a light scrubbing motion with the water-soaked gauze
 
6. Wet a cotton swab with distilled or deionized water and swab each of the 32 positions on the

7. Use a dry gauze to dry the incubator when you have finished cleaning. incubator, as well as the aspiration station

### C) Clean the rinse stations

The analyzer has one rinse station for the sample/reagent probe and the microbead mixer, and another for the sipper probe. They should be cleaned regularly. 

1. Move the probe to an area away from the rinse stations

2. Aspirate the water out of the microbead mixer rinse station using a syringe with tubing attached

3. Use a cotton swab soaked in 70% alcohol to clean thoroughly the microbead mixer rinse station and the sipper rinse stations

4. Wipe the microbead mixer rinse station and the sipper rinse station again using a fresh cotton swab soaked in distilled or deionized water.

5. Fill the syringe with distilled or deionized water, and refill the microbead mixer rinse station. This should take approximately 50-100 mL of water.

6. Aspirate the water out of the microbead mixer rinse station again, by using the syringe

7. Refill the microbead mixer rinse station, and flush all the rinse stations with distilled or deionized water again.

### D) Liquid flow cleaning

Contamination in the sipper system may degrade sample accuracy and precision, or possibly block the measuring cell flow. To keep the sipper liquid flow clean and maintain the accuracy of the measuring cell, perform the following( liquid flow cleaning )procedural steps in the correct order:

1. Open the sipper shield. 

2. Remove the ProCell bottle from bottle set 1 in the system reagent compartment. 

3. Fill the 'USER' compartment (the smaller compartment) of the SysClean adapter to the ledge of the compartment with SysClean reagent. The compartment holds approximately 9 mL of fluid. 

4. Carefully insert the filled SysClean adapter into the ProCell position of bottle set 1 in the system reagent compartment, with the edge marked 'USER' facing the back of the analyzer 
 
5. Make sure that ProCell and CleanCell bottles are correctly located in the other three positions 

6. Close the sipper shield.

7. Choose Utility > Maintenance

8. Select Maintenance from the Maintenance Type list 

9. Select Liquid Flow Cleaning from the Maintenance Items list

10. Choose Select to open the Liquid Flow Cleaning window

11. Type 1 in the Cycles text box and choose Start. Wait for the analyzer to return to Standby

12. Open the sipper shield and remove the SysClean adapter

13. Return the ProCell bottle to its correct position in bottle set 1 in the system reagent compartment

14. Close the sipper shield
