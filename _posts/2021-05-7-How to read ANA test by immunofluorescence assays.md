In this article I will take about **ANA** (Antinuclear antibodies test) and the patterns of ANA.
ANA: It is one of the most important tests for diagnosing Autoimmune diseases, after reading this article you will be able to distinguish types of patterns and the most important diseases associated with each type in a simplified way.
<br>

To begin with, these tests are explained by IFA Indirect immunofluorescence assays (The gold standard of diagnosis Autoimmune diseases) which is by preparing the slides that fixed by HEp-2 tissue, and then reading them under a fluorescent microscope

<br>
**Procedure of preparation ANA test slides:**

1. For qualitative IgG antibody determination, prepare a 1:40 screening dilution of each test sample in PBS. Prepare all dilutions in a minimum volume of 0.10 ml with PBS as the diluent.
  
2. For semi-quantitative titration of sera, prepare two-fold serial dilutions of the serum sample in PBS, starting with a 1:40 dilution, and adding equal volumes of diluted serum or plasma and PBS for each consecutive dilution.
  
3. Remove slides from protective pouch and apply 1 drop (approximately 20 Âµl) of the diluted test sample(s) to each well. 
  Add sufficient volume to completely cover each well, but cross-mixing of contents between wells should not occur. 
  Note: Each dayâ€™s test run requires one well each for positive control, negative control, and PBS (conjugate control). 
  Incubate the slides in a moist chamber for 30 minutes at 37Â°C.
  
4. Rinse the slides in a light stream of buffer. Avoid directing the stream at the wells.
  
5. Wash the slides for 10 minutes with a change of PBS solution after 5 minutes. Agitate the slides by moving the rack up and down in the buffer.
  
6. Blot the paint mask surrounding the test wells with the special blotters.
  
7. Apply one drop of the ready to use conjugate to each test well.
  
8. Repeat steps 4 (incubation), 5 (PBS rinse), 6 (10 minute PBS wash), and 7 (blot).
  
9. Apply the glycerol mounting media and 22 X 50 mm glass coverslip.
  
10. Observe the reactivity under fluorescence microscopy using 20-40X magnification.

For best results, examine slides immediately after completion of the test. To obtain equivalent results, seal slides or keep humidified to minimize dehydration of mounting medium, store in dark at 2-8Â°C, and read within three days. 
Positive reactivity may range in fluorescence intensity from brilliant to weak. Grade the fluorescence reaction according to the following intensity scale:

4+ (brilliant), 3+ (bright), 2+ (moderate) and 1+ (weak).

**Dilution of ANA test:**
-The dilution buffer to reduce nonspecific binding of serum globulins to the HEp-2 cells.
-ANA screening on HEp-2 cells is performed at serum dilutions between 1/40 and 1/160 depending on the laboratory, (Cut-off may be increase to 1/160 depend to the laboratory)
-Paediatric samples are run at 1/25. 
The serum sample should be diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2-7.4 and 100 Âµg/mL sodium azide. Tween 20 (0.5 g/L), bovine serum albumin (20 g/L) or dilute HEp-2 medium can be added

**HEp-2 cells is the best type of tissue for diagnosis of ANA test**:

because HEp-2 cells have many advantages over rodent tissues:

1.They are a more sensitive substrate that allows identification of many patterns.

2.Human origin ensures better specificity than animal tissues.

3.The nuclei are much larger so complex nuclear details can be seen.

4.The cell monolayer ensures that all nuclei are visible.

5.Cell division rates are higher so that antigens produced only in cell division are easily located eg. centromere and mitotic spindle patterns.

6.There is no obscuring of the intercellular matrix.

7.Antigen distribution is uniform.

Over 35 different IFA patterns, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, have been described.

**Comments on interpretation**:

ANA patterns are only indicative and the specificity of the autoantibody must always be confirmed by other techniques, such as CIE, immunoblotting, EIA etc.

**Interpretation of result (Titer-Dilution):**
**Negative:** Normal titer less than 1/40 dilution
(Cut-off may be increase to 1/160 depend to the laboratory)
**Positive:** Normal patient without underlying disease: 3-30%
**Low positive:** (&lt; 1/80) not likely to be significant
**High positive** ( &gt; 1/320) significant




There are four basic ANA patterns, and the Speckeld pattern take 40-70% (most common pattern and less specific one) 
We start with the first type of patterns
![ANA.patterns](/images/ANA_immunoflurecent/ANA.patterns.png)

1-[Homogeneous pattern ]()
Uniform diffuse fluorescence staining of the entire nucleus in interphase cells
It is associated with the diagnosis of Systemic lupus erythematosus ([SLE]()) Antibodies against ssDNA / dsDNA and histone antigens.

**a chromosome in the stage of metaphase and telophase of mitotic cell is positive**

image..................
2- [Speckeld pattern ]()
It is associated with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome, SLE and mixed connective tissue disorders (MCTD) Antibodies to Sm, RNP, SS-A / SS-B, PM-1, and PCNA antigen.

**a chromosome in the stage of metaphase and telophase of mitotic cell is negative**

.................

3-[ Nuleolar pattern]()

It is associated with the diagnosis of Systemic sclerosis (SS) And some cases of SLE, and we observe a nucleoid stain inside the nucleus with the presence of a chromosome in the Metaphase of mitotic cell

4- [Centromere pattern ]()

It is associated with the diagnosis of CREST, and we notice the presence of small points extending on the nucleus, up to 90 points, with the presence of a chromosome in the stage of metaphase and telophase of mitotic cell

5-[ Rim pattern]()
Uniform diffuse nuclear staining similar to homogeneous staining with greater intensity at its outer rim

**a chromosome in the stage of metaphase and telophase of mitotic cell is negative**
<br>
Other type of tissue like Rodent liver, kidney, stomach sections are useful for the detection of anti-mitochondrial antibodies due to the distinct staining pattern on each tissue.

It is called **AMA** in Rodent liver, kidney, stomach sections and **Mitochondrial pattern** in HEp2

This type of pattern appear in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), an M2 ELISA should be used to confirm a positive test.

**Mix patterns:**
patient sera frequently contain several different autoantibodies that result in mixed patterns.
Single serum may produce a mixed patterns 
Mixed ANA patterns occur when patient sera contain more than one autoantibody specificity depending on dulition
 For example when antibodies against U1-snRNP are associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies in the serum of an SLE patient, the nuclear pattern will be homogeneous and the condensed chromatin of cells in mitosis will be strongly positive. However, at a higher dilution, the typical speckled pattern for antibodies against U1-snRNP may be seen. 
`Different serum dilutions thereby produce different fluorescence patterns and it is not possible to judge the titre of an autoantibody from a single serum dilution`

1- Rim pattern might be seen at low dilution and homogeneous patter at higher dilution 
2- Frequently homogenous and/or peripheral pattern seen at low dilution and speckled pattern at higher dilution

An illustration to find out the correct place to read the slide, the red place we do not read in it because the distribution and shape of the cells are not correct

.......................

After knowing the type of pattern, survive to write the result, the estimation of the titer starts from 1/80, and according to the brightness, the stronger the pattern increases. This beautiful picture shows the gradation of lighting and writing a report on its basis

.........................

With this I have concluded this simple and important article of mine interested in the section And there are other types of patterns that fall under each type that I would like to mention so as not to confuse the information because it is important to prove the basic types, and then we can expand and mention the other types.

I hope this information is useful ðŸŒ¸
