title: How to write malaria report
---

You can diagnosis  malaria from thick and thin area of the blood smears (gold standard of malaria diagnosis)

1.**Thick** area of the malaria smears  are more sensitive test more than the thin area because to the greater volume of blood
Report the numbers of parasites (trophozoites (ring form), schizonts, and gametocytes) and also whether malaria pigment is present in white cell

1-10 (Ring)  per 100 high power ﬁelds  (+1)

11-100 (Ring) per 100 high power fields (+2)

1-10 (Ring)  in every high power fields (+3) ≥ than 10 (Ring) in every high power fields (+4)
e.g. Report: ring form and Gametocytes of **plasmodium falciparum** are seen (p.f.r^(+3)  & g)

2.**Thin** area have fewer blood cells to diagnosis the type of *plasmodium*species and count the percentage of parasitized red cells when there is high **falciparum** malaria parasitaemia (+3) or more parasites seen in the thick ﬁlm to determine the degree of the infection that help in treatment
Estimating parasite numbers/µl of blood by using the oil immersion objective

Parasite count = (WBC count*Parasites counted against 100 WBC )/100

Type of **plasmodium** species:

1. **Plasmodium falciparum**: High parasitaemia. Only trophozoites (ring form) and gametocytes usually seen, Schizonts only seen in severe infections
2. **Plasmodium vivax**: Rarely more than 2% of cells infected. Trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes usually seen
3. **Plasmodium malariae**: Rarely more than 1% of cells infected. Trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes usually seen
4. **Plasmodium ovale** : Trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes usually seen
