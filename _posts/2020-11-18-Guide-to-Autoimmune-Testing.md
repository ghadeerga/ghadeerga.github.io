title: Guide to Autoimmune Testing
---

"Guide to Autoimmune Testing" is one of the most beautiful books in explaining autoimmune diseases in amazingly straight forward way. Diagnosis tests are well presented and ordered alphabetically. You can get any information quickly without wasting time searching online or in references. 

Each test contains the method, Indication, reference ranges and how positive answer result is interpreted.

Example for one of the tests mentioned in this book is **ANA screen(HEp-2 cells)**


**Indication**

Suspicion of collagenosis diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, primary Sjögren’s syndrome, chronic active hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemic purpura, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, drug induced lupus.


**Method**

Indirect immunoﬂuorescence with human epithelial cells (HEp-2 cells) as antigen.

**Answer**

The result is given as negative, + (weak positive), ++ (positive), +++ (strong positive) depending on the intensity of the ﬂuorescence and is divided into 8 patterns. Weak positive ﬂuorescence is observed in 5% of healthy men and women. It occurs more often in women in the menopause and in persons older than 65.

**Referencerange**

Negative.


**Interpretation**

Positive ANA, patterns 7 and 8, is supplemented automatically with ANA titration, ENA screen (Sm, nRNP, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1), anti-dsDNA and anti-histones. High titers (1/640) are particularly observed in systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, primary Sjögren’s syndrome, chronic active hepatitis and hypergammaglobulinemic purpura. When the reactivity is weak, it is often difﬁcult to distinguish between the nuclear antibody patterns 7 and 8.

In addition, it contains an explanation of the most important **methods** used in diagnosis such as:

1. Indirect Immunoﬂuorescence
2. Direct ELISA
3. Capture ELISA
4. Immunoblot

At the end of the book, there are three tables summarizing the most important tests for “Systemic diseases and Rheumatology”, “Gastroenterology and Endocrinology” and “Neurology and other diseases.
