We usually prepare N.S in the laboratory for several uses. And, we should make sure that our preparation is accurate by:

1.Put 1 mL of N.S that we had prepared into test tube

2.Add two drop of the blood in the same test tube

3.Centerfuge for 1 mines 

If the N.S suspension is clear: accurate preparation.

If the N.S suspension is hemolysis: defect preparation.
