Following are the procedures for the daily maintenance in details

#### A- Check Waste Tube/Tank Connection 

![Waste_tubes](/images/waste tubes.jpg)

1- Check that the waste tube is clear and not folded

2- Check If the waste tube is not connected properly, wast tank may overflow, resulting in environmental contamination or carryover.

![Waste_tubes](/images/waste tubes2.jpg)

Select Utility -> Maintenance -> Maintenance and then select Scheduled Maintenance – Daily.

Mark the Select checkbox to the right of Check Waste Tank Connection.
Select OK

3- The system status should be in Incubation or Standby.

#### B- Check Consumable Status

Consumables include sample diluent, substrate, cuvette, container, probe wash solution and wash buffer. Insufficient consumables will affect or stop the tests. Develop the habit prior any tess to check the volume, and refill if necessary

You are allowed to do this maintenance procedure in any system status
Select Reagent – Consumable Management, or select Reagent - Reagent Overview.

![Reagent_Overview](/images/Reagent Overview.png)

As you see in the picture above 

- Two substrate bottle, the volume of each should be 300
- Two tray cuvettes, each should contain 85
- Waste bin, 188 when it is empty
- Wash solution, 100%  when it is full
- Waste tank has a sensor, Ok mark
- Wash buffer, 100% when it is full

#### C- Check Syringe

The syringe is used to aspirate/dispense small amount of sample and reagent. If the syringe leaks, it cannot aspirate/dispense the correct amount of sample or reagent, and may even be damaged. Make sure to regularly check the syringe for leak

In case of a T piece leakage

1. Use dry gauze to wipe the T piece, and tighten the T piece
2. Check the T piece again. If the leak remains, check if the washer inside the syringe connector is intact
3. If the washer is damaged, replace it with a new one
4. Select Utility - Maintenance - Maintenance and then select Scheduled Maintenance – Daily.
Mark the Select checkbox to the right of Check Syringe

Select OK to refresh the current date as the performance date

#### D- Check Probe

Abnormal probe may influence the measurement performance and result in inaccurate results. Prior to measurements every day, check the probe for stains and crystals, and check if the wash well is clogged

Make sure that the system status is Incubation or Standby

Open the upper protective shield

1. Clean Interior and Exterior probe
2. Wipe the probe by alcohol-cotton then by deionized water, because the dirt on its surfaces is causing carryover between samples or reagents and resulting in inaccurate results. It's recommended to perform this procedure every day
3. Select Utility -> Maintenance -> Maintenance -> Maintenance Command > Select Clean Probe Interior and Clean Probe Exterior 

![Check_Probe](/images/maintenance instrucitons.png)

Select Continue

#### D. Daily Clean 

Clean function is used to clean the probe, and dispersion aspirate probes to keep good performance, avoid probe clogging and reduce influence of the probe carryover on the test result. 3.1ml concentrated wash solution is consumed during Daily Clean process


1- Add sufficient concentrated wash solution into the 62ml reagent bottle, and place it in the special wash position

![daily_clean](/images/daily_clean.png)


2- Select Utility - Maintenance – Maintenance and then select Maintenance Command.

3- Select Daily Clean.


#### F. Effect Check

Effect check is used to avoid crystallization in probe washing tubes, dispersion dispensing tubes and substrate dispensing tubes and monitor the liquid contamination and the working status of the photometric system. If you do not enable Effect Check on the Auto maintenance setup window, incorrect test results may be produced

1- To enable the auto maintenance

2- Select Utility -> System Setup

3- Below the screen, Select Instrument F1 

![system_settings](/images/system settings.jpg)


4- Select Auto Maintenance

![auto_maintenance](/images/system setup.jpg)


The purpose is to avoid crystallization in probe washing tubes, dispersion and substrate dispensing tubes. Also to monitor the liquid contamination and the working status of the photometric system.
