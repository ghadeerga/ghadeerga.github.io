title: Source of errors that we must know about CBC test in hematology 
---


Although the development of devices of [#CBC](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/CBC) analysers However, there are source of errors that we must know and pay attention to them while working ðŸ”¬

In this article is one of the most important things you can read about the sources of errors of hematology and the solutions.

One of the most important error that we can face is the high or low of some marker of CBC, in fact it is neither high nor low, but there are reasons that leads to this.

We will start with Hb:

**ðŸ”´ Falsely high of [#Hemoglobin](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/hemoglobin:) level:**

Because the measurement of Hb level depends on its absorption of light at the wavelength at 540 nm. So:

1. The turbid sample (due to a high WBC count or high lipid percentage) caused an
  increase in the level of Hb
2. Smoking also causes an increase in the level of Hb in the blood due to the
  increase in carboxyhemoglobin

To solve this error, we centrifuge the sample to precipitate white blood cells or lipid that cause turbidity in the sample, then replace the amount of plasma by Normal Saline then measure by the device and it will be an accurate value of Hb âœ”

**ðŸ”´ Falsely high of [#RBC](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/RBC)s count:**

The device reads the large platelets as RBCs, causing a rise in the number of red blood cells.

To solve this error, make blood film and confirm the absence of Large platelets

**ðŸ”´ Falsely low [#RBC](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/RBC)s count:**

Cold agglutination.To solve this error, Put the sample in a water bath to warm the sample.

**ðŸ”´ Falsely high [#MCV:](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/MCV:)**

Cold agglutination sample reduces the number of blood cells as a number, but as a volume, it increases in size and causes an increase in MCV.

The results of PCV, MCH and MCHC depend on calculating the results of Hb, RBCs count and MCV, so if there is an error in these results, it also causes an error in the rest of the tests.

**ðŸ”´ Falsely high [#WBC](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/WBC) count:**

There are many reasons that can cause an increase in WBCs cells, but the most common reasons are:

1. Nucleated red cell (NRBCs):

To solve this error:

- By some CBC devices by putting the sample on "NRBC mode" *
- Performing a manual count by counting NRBCs within 100 WBC cells.

2. Nonlysis of RBCs:

As a target cell that does not lysis and the device reads it as WBCs cells, and this condition occurs in hemoglobinophathiesðŸ”½.

To solve this error:

By some CBC devices by putting the sample on "RBCs lysis mode"

3. Giant platelets or platelet clumps:

because of EDTA may be the solution to this case sometimes by re-sampling the sample in Citrate tube.

**ðŸ”´ Falsely increased [#Lymphocyte](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/Lymphocyte) count:**

The presence of:

-Giant platelets

-Nonlysis of RBCs

-Nucleated red cell

The device reads them as Lymphocyte cells, which causes their number to rise.

To solve this error:

Make blood film individual and confirm the absence of these cells.

**ðŸ”´ Falsely increased [#Eosinophil](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/eosinophil) count:**

1. Neutrophils with hemosiderin granules (counted as eosinophils).
  
2. Red cells with malarial pigments may be read by the machine as eosinophil cells.
  

**ðŸ”´ Falsely high [#Platelet](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/platelet) count:**

-Fragmented red cells (in microangiopathic [#hemolysis)](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/hemolysis)

-Fragmented white cells (in [#leukemia)](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/leukemia)

The device may read it as [#platelets](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/platelet).

**ðŸ”´ Falsely low [#Platelet](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/platelet) count:**

Agglutination Sample is one of the most important causes of low platelets

To solve this error:

Re-sampling the sample

Finally we must know that we cannot depend on CBC analyzer only. Manual test is to ensure all these sources of errors that we may face in the CBC devices .

I hope it will be useful and help us to perform better and more accurate results.
