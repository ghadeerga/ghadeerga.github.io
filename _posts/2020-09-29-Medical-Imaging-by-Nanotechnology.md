title: OPEN ELISA 

---


OPEN ELISA assays are performed on standardized plates containing(96 Wells)

1. After receiving the samples,  insert them into a Centrifuge device for sample separation, but in  case of QF assays the samples are placed in the incubator as soon as they are withdrawn for 24 hours

2. Write down the names and numbers of the samples in your lab notebook

3. Take the solutions out of the refrigerator before starting

4. Prepare the samples with diluent and add them to Wells as describe in your kit manual

5. Cover the Wells and incubate the samples for sometime then wash them to get rid of non-binding antibodies

6. Adding the Conjugate solution and then incubate the samples then washing them again

7. Add Substrate solution, then incubate samples in a dark place

8. Add the stop solution to stop the reaction

9. The readings are taken from ELISA reading device at the appropriate wavelength, the resulting color absorption strength is proportional to the concentration of the antibody in the sample, and the reading is carried out by Quantitative method which is using several (standards) solutions that come with previously known concentration. Concentration and absorption values are used to calculation of the results. The Qualitative method is done by calculating the absorbance value of the sample and then dividing it by the Cut off value

10. Write down the results in the notebook, then save them in system. 

These are the basic steps for the manual operation of ELISA device, but generally, each kit has its own steps that differ from one company to another in terms of the method of diluting the sample, the number of washing times and test duration that may take one to four hours for one test.
