title: Abnormal result on CBC report
---

 
CBC test is part of a routine medical exam. If there is an abnormal result on your CBC, what other tests might the doctor suggest?

1. **Abnormal results for WBCs** may be followed by a culture of the affected area.
 If inflammation is suspected, then a CRP or ESR test may be done.
 
2. **Abnormal RBCs** may request a reticulocyte count, iron studies, tests for vitamin B12 and folic acid, G6PD, or hemoglobinopathy evaluation to help make a diagnosis.

3. **Abnormal platelet count** may be followed by tests that further evaluate platelets, such as platelet function tests or HIT antibody. Additional tests may also be done to check for bleeding disorders or excessive clotting disorders such as PT, PTT, von Willebrand factor or coagulation factors. In some serious conditions such as leukemia, myelodysplasia or another bone marrow disorder is suspected, then a bone marrow biopsy and examination may be necessary. Numerous other tests specific for certain conditions may be needed to establish a diagnosis.
