Lipid panel is used as part of a cardiac risk assessment and to monitor treatment of unhealthy lipid levels

A lipid panel typically includes:

• **Total cholesterol** - measures of all the cholesterol in all the lipoprotein particles
    
• **High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)** - measures the cholesterol in HDL particles; often called "good cholesterol" 

• **Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)** - measures the cholesterol in LDL particles; often called "bad cholesterol .Usually, the amount of LDL-C is calculated using the results of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides.
    
• **Triglycerides** - measures all the triglycerides in all the lipoprotein particles
    
• **Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)** - calculated from triglycerides/5; this formula is based on the typical composition of VLDL particles.
   
• **Non-HDL-C** - calculated from total cholesterol minus HDL-C
    
• **Cholesterol/HDL ratio** - calculated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C
    
    
There are studies that suggested that lipid test required fasting patients for 9-12 hours (drinking water only), and allow non-fasting lipid testing. In particular, children, teens and young adults (ages 2 to 24) may have testing done without fasting. And, according to a new analysis recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine fasting is not needed before cholesterol and other lipid levels. 


New analysis methodology:

1. Compared results of fasting and non-fasting samples drawn four weeks from the same individuals

2. No treatment given during the time of analysis 

3. More than 8,000 study participants were included in the analysis

4. Patients were followed for a median of 3.3 years for major coronary events (e.g., heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, and related deaths.
The analysis found little difference between the fasting and non-fasting lipid results from the same individuals. The only difference was moderately higher triglyceride levels in non-fasting samples, which was expected.  Lipid panel test without fasting  would be easier for patients but also patients should ask their doctors. If other tests require fasting as Fasting blood sugar then fasting may still be required.
