Today I will talk  how to use the device [`Stat_Fax_2100_Microplate_Reader`](https://rattibha.com/hashtag/Stat_Fax_2100_Microplate_Reader)

![](/images/stat-fax/Stat-fax-2100.png)

This device is used in the ELISA department using a microplate to read the
analyzes of immunity, hormones, as well as viruses using light absorption
technology (if you understand the mechanism of this device, you will be able to
understand any other ELISA device)

The device is designed:

‚úî It reads the results in a way: Monochromatically or biochromatically 

‚úî At the wavelength 340nm - 700nm 

‚úî It can read and print 96 wells within 2 minutes

**Some abbreviation of the keys of the device:**

![](/images/stat-fax/Stat-fax.jpg)

**ABS**= Absorbance Mode 

**STND**= Single Calibrator Mode

**C.OFF**= Cutoff Modes

**%ABS**= Percent Absorbance Multi-Point
**PGM**= Point to Point Mode 

**POLY**= Best Fit Polynomial Function 

**REGR**= Best Fit Linear Function

**CNTRL**: to determine where to
place the controls

**BLNK**: to put the plank and be the first 

**END**: to determine the last well that the device reads..like if we only have three samples we program the device to read it 3 well only if we do not press END the device will read it all 96 Wells and we will waste time and effort

**Mix**: for the plate before reading the result

**Self check Key:** The device will check:

-Intensity of the lamp 

-Rotation of the filter
-The X_Y motion of the plate - The movement of the plate

-The printer 

and when the device finishes the checking process, the printer will
register **(Systems Check OK)** this message means the device ready to work.

Self check is the maintenance of the device

The device contains more than one way to read the enzyme immunoassays and similar assays. 

I will explain the most important ways the device works on.

The first mode üëá 

1. *Absorbance only (ABS key) *
   
   In this type, the absorbance of the samples is read with the selection of the
   appropriate wavelength. Blanking on the first well is optional.

2. *Single calibrator (STND key) *
   
   In this mode the device accepts only one cal. 
   
   The result Concentration is calculated based on (single-point standard curve)
   
   Calculation equation is (the concentration of calibrator √∑ the absorbance of calibrator)
   
    Blanking on the first well is compulsory in the first well A-1

3. *Cutoff Modes *
   
   a number of negative controls are read, then a number of Cutoff Controls, followed by a number of positive controls.  Blanking on the first well is optional. 

We read according to the absorption mode, as
follows:

We press **ABS key**, then add the **wavelength**, for example, 450-650, then
we press the **End key**  to determine how much we want to read Wells , for
example, two or three, and so on, then we press   **Read key**

4. *Multi calibration Mode (Point to point mode) *

This is one of the most important mode.

The instrument accepts a number of calibrators (from 2 to 7) , then calculate concentrations based on the point-to-point calibration curve. 

Blanking, graphing, and editing options are available.



The shape of the non-accepted curve üëá

![](/images/stat-fax/Unacceptable-curve-stat-fax-2100.png)

Determining the shape of the curve, is it ascending or
descending, from the manufacturer. 

If you see this curve, that means the
higher the colour concentration, the higher the result value.

But if the programming was done and the shape of the curve was as in the picture:

![](/images/stat-fax/Curve2-stat-fax.png)

This shape will be the higher the colour of concentration, the lower the result value.

It means the opposite of the previous curve.

In this picture is an example of a test programmed in a multi calibration mode - point to point, and 6 Cals was entered as shown in the picture, the first one has a value of 0 U/mL and the last one has a value of 200 U/mL.

The curve has a direct relationship between the absorbance values ‚Äã‚Äãand
the concentration values ‚Äã‚Äãof Cals.

One of the important thing when program a new test, the programming must be saved immediately by pressing the **Store key**

<br>

![](/images/stat-fax/Name-test.stat-fax.png)

then Name the test by alphabet letters that appear in screen.

<br>

When you name the test press **Read key** after each letter, then when you finished press **Enter key**.

The device is equipped with a memory to save the programming tests up to 30 tests in a point-to-point mode. We print them by:

pressing **the test key**

then **number 99**

then **Enter key**

The device will print all the saved tests‚úî

**Blank**: 

Adding the Blank is optional, except in the Single calibration mode, It is compulsory in the first well A-1 with the Cal in the programming.

The question appears Blank Y/N in the programming of any mode
if we choose Yes. This means that the programming will always be saved with the
Blank.

**So what is Blank's purpose?**

We know that the plank in chemistry devices is intended to make zero the device. But in these devices, their purpose is different. They do not zero the device, but rather do a correction of the readings. In other words, in the blank, we test the components of the
solution, such as Substrate, which is responsible for showing the color at the
last step.

We add an empty well next to the samples without
adding any solution to it. We incubate and wash it until the Substrate step comes. We Substrate, then read. 

The value of the blank we subtract from the value of the samples.

In this picture, an explanation of how to add blank with samples ‚úî

- Pay attention when reading the result to wipe the bottom of the well from any fingerprints because this place is sensitive to the passage of light from it 

- The absence of any bubbles in the well when reading the result.

With this, we got to know the most important things
about this device in a simplified way üçÉ and it is considered essential
in any other Elisa device.. I hope this article is useful üåº
