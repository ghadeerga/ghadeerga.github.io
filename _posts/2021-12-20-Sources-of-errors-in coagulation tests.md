title: Sources of errors in coagulation tests
---

<br>
Â There are various sources of erroneous test results in coagulation testing, and these are addressed in the following:

### Falsely prolonged clotting times:

- Underfilling of citrate tube
  
- Polycythemia
  
- Sample from indwelling catheters (dilution or contamination with anticoagulant)
  

### Falsely shortened clotting times:

- Overfilling of citrate tube
  
- Traumatic phlebotomy
  
- Turbid plasma (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hyperbilirubinemia) in optical instrument
  

### Falsely shortened aPTT in patients on heparin:

- Delay in separation of plasma from platelets Elevated factor VIII (acute phase reactant)
  

### Falsely prolonged TT:

- Dysfibrinogenemia
  
- Elevated levels of FDPs and paraproteins
  
- Amyloidosis
  
- Heparin-like anticoagulants (in malignancy)
  

### Falsely high FDPs and D-dimer:

- Rheumatoid factor
  

### Falsely abnormal platelet function:

- Lipidemia
  
- Hemolysis
  
- Thrombocytopenia
  

### Falsely low factor levels:

- Heparin
  
- Lepirudin
  
- Danaparoid
  
- Argatroban
  

### False-positive results of lupus anticoagulant tests:

- Heparin
  
- Lepirudin
  
- Danaparoid
  
- Argatroban
